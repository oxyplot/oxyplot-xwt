Contribute to OxyPlot
=====================

OxyPlot is driven by the community and contributors like you. We are excited that you're interested to help us move forward and improve OxyPlot.
Have a look at the following tips to get started quickly. 

## Creating a pull request

Contributions to the project are greatly appreciated. But please read the [requirements](http://oxyplot.org/documentation/contributions) before submitting a pull request.



## Reporting issues

Please use the [discussion forums](http://discussion.oxyplot.org/) if you are unsure whether it is a bug in the library or a problem in your code.
When you are sure, please add defects in the issue tracker.
It is very helpful to get the code (use CTRL+ALT+C in the plot control) and report (CTRL+ALT+R) of the bug plot
You could use services like http://snipt.org or https://gist.github.com to share code snippets.

### A report should include
- used platform and tools version
- used OxyPlot version
- version of dependencies (e.g. Xamarin.Forms and Android SDK)
- description of the issue
- sample code to reproduce the issue



## Common rules

To prevent the issue (backlog) list to grow indefinitely, an issue will be closed when you are not responding to requests by a project developer.
We need your help, so we will not close an issue by desire. But when you are not answering to a request by for a month we will close the issue.
If this happens in accident, feel free to re-open the issue...

The issue reporter can close the issue because:
- he/she verified the fix/change
- found out that it is not an OxyPlot issue but some problem in his/her code

In case the reporter does not respond to a request:
- a project developer is allowed to close the issue (after one month)

Someone can take over the issue from the reporter, when:
- he/she can reproduce the issue
- has some sample code
- has more time/information to assist in the resolution
- responds to requests by a project developer
